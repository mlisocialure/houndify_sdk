# houndify_sdk
Houndify is a really cool platform by Sound Hound that allows anyone to add smart, voice enabled, conversational interfaces 
to anything with an internet connection.
For more information on this see here:https://www.houndify.com/docs


The platform is still in beta. This little project is aimed at automating the maintenance and upgrade of 
the deployment instances of a houndify SDK.

Here I use a customized houndify SDK example, using the javascript SDK from Houndify as a template
added some unit tests via mocha to test out all the endpoints,  
and automated the basic admin side functions of upgrading and deploying instances of the app deployment via scripts written
in fabric.py (Fore more information on fabric see here http://www.fabfile.org). 



These allows the Houndify API user to easily push all changes onto production, along with all updated tests, and git commit, 
all by typing out a simple python script from the command line.
